This website is intended to be used as a companion to Georgia Tech's Design Scripting
class (ARCH 3844/7030/8833), taught by Russell Newton in Spring 2025.
Much of the content and learning material of the course will be posted and
distributed via this website. This way, it can be used as a reference when
completing assignments, developing the final project, and any time in the future.

All other course material such as the syllabus, schedule, and announcements will
be distributed through Canvas.

Course Overview
===============

.. start overview

Computer programming is nearly ubiquitous as a tool for problem solving and automation
across many disciplines, from engineering to analytics, even to design.
For architects and designers, computer programming can be used to create, explore,
and evaluate design ideas.

Students in this course will progress from the basics of programming to advanced
approaches in algorithmic design. By the end of the semester, students are expected
to establish the fundamentals of computer programming and demonstrate control of
computer programming as a facilitator of design.
