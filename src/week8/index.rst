==============================
Week 8: Iterative Rule Systems
==============================

:bdg-muted-line:`Monday, Feb 24, 2025`

This week, we'll start a discussion about systems that can be repeatedly applied
to an initial design (and its subsequent outputs) to create interesting designs. A hallmark
of the types of systems that we'll be looking at is the presence of a set
of rules that define how the system updates the current design. Different rules can
create wildly different designs after multiple iterations of the system. Iterative
systems have applications outside of design, from physics to mathematics, but we'll be
focusing on those that have implications for design.
