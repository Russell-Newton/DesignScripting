    | Georgia Tech

Computer programming is nearly ubiquitous as a tool for problem solving and automation
across many disciplines, from engineering to analytics, even to design.
For architects and designers, computer programming can be used to create, explore,
and evaluate design ideas.

Students in this course will progress from the basics of programming to advanced
approaches in algorithmic design. By the end of the semester, students are expected
to establish the fundamentals of computer programming and demonstrate control of
computer programming as a facilitator of design.
