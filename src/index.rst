.. admonition:: Attendance Checks
    :class: caution

    Starting in Week 4, we will be doing attendance checks on CodingBat. These are
    custom problems that I have made to get you all thinking with Python.

    To access the problems, go to my `CodingBat account's home page <https://codingbat.com/home/rnewton31@gatech.edu/ds-attendance>`__.
    Make sure you're logged in to your account before solving!
