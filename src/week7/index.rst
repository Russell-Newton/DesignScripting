Week 7: Designing an Algorithmic Process
========================================

:bdg-muted-line:`Monday, Feb 17, 2025`

Algorithm design is a hard thing to teach and learn and an even harder thing to master.
Within the realm of programmatic design, though, an algorithm that creates
a design language often starts by identifying a manual process and adapting it into
something that a computer can do. For this course, and likely if/when you use scripting
in your designs, these processes don't need to be perfect. If they work as you'd like,
that's a good place to be.

This week, we'll be taking a look at the inspiration for :doc:`Assignment 3 <../assignments/3-cluster-sprawls>`,
I'll go over how I went from inspiration to trying out a handful of manual processes
to creating a Grasshopper script that could emulate the manual process. In class,
I'll have you develop manual processes for creating a design language of your choice,
based on the same inspiration I had, and we'll discuss how you might refine these processes
into something your computer could do.
