Python in Grasshopper
=====================

I can't make a better guide on the Python 3 script component than the
`official guide <https://developer.rhino3d.com/guides/scripting/scripting-gh-python/>`__.
So, in an effort to avoid duplicating a whole bunch of information, refer to that guide.

The most important sections for this course are:

* `Python Component <https://developer.rhino3d.com/guides/scripting/scripting-gh-python/#python-component>`__
* `Inputs, Outputs <https://developer.rhino3d.com/guides/scripting/scripting-gh-python/#inputs-outputs>`__
* `Script-Mode <https://developer.rhino3d.com/guides/scripting/scripting-gh-python/#script-mode>`__
* `Debugging Scripts <https://developer.rhino3d.com/guides/scripting/scripting-gh-python/#debugging-scripts>`__
* `PyPI Packages <https://developer.rhino3d.com/guides/scripting/scripting-gh-python/#pypi-packages>`__

Additional important references are:

* `Grasshopper data trees and Python <https://developer.rhino3d.com/guides/rhinopython/grasshopper-datatrees-and-python/>`__
