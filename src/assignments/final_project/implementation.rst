Implementation
==============

:bdg-danger-line:`Due: Thursday, May 1, 2025`

Your implementation is heavily dependent upon your chosen topic. As such, the
requirements for this part of the final project are somewhat vague.

Importantly, you will need to provide

#. Your implementation of your project, and
#. Artifacts demonstrating your project.

You will likely be implementing your project within Grasshopper, using at least one
Python 3 script component. If you create any supplemental Rhino models or Python scripts,
these are considered part of your implementation.

.. admonition:: Getting My Help
    :class: warning

    I'm willing to help you with your implementations, short of writing code. If you
    have questions on how to do something or if you'd like my help debugging something,
    I can help with that.

    In some particularly challenging cases, I can help you write code, but I'd suggest
    asking the generative AI of your choice for help first. They do a good job of
    explaining things, and they're a useful tool if you intend to do any sort of
    programming in the future. They're not perfect, and I can help you fix any issues
    or figure out how to ask the question to the generative AI. Where this fails, I can
    write some code for you to make something work, if it's something that would be
    out of the scope of this course's content.

Multiple Inputs, Multiple Outputs
=================================

One way of starting your implementation would be to choose a specific input
to create an output from, but your implementation will need to support creating multiple
outputs. Whether this is facilitated by randomness or by having variable inputs or by
some other mechanism of your choosing, I will need to see that you can do more than
one thing with your implementation.

Artifacts
=========

:bdg-info-line:`Weight: 5%`

You'll need something beyond just your implementation files to demonstrate your project,
which could include pictures, renderings, data points, or anything else that you might
want to use to show off your project. These should be something that can be recreated
with your implementation files and the right inputs.

The pictures I required on assignments 2, 3, and 4 are artifacts. If your project
creates something with Grasshopper, your artifacts might similarly be pictures.
