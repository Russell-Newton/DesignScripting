=============
Final Project
=============

The requirements for the final project for this course are fairly loose. You will choose
a topic, implement a solution with some amount of Python code, and report on your results.
The topic can be anything that interests you, as long as you implement some portion
of it with Python. I'll provide some potential topic ideas, in case you're not sure
where to start.

.. admonition:: Team Projects (Optional)
    :class: important

    If you would like, you can work on this project in teams of up to 3 members, but the
    expected workload for team projects will be higher.

Grade Breakdown
===============

All parts of the project sum up to 30% of your final grade in this course. A further
breakdown is shown below:

Project Schedule
================

The rest of this semester is going to be very busy for your other courses and studios,
and I want to provide as much time in class for you to work on this project, so that you
can prioritize your time outside of class for other courses, where possible. During
these in-class working days, I will be available to answer questions and provide support,
as necessary.

You will be expected to present on your selected topics, your progress on Week 13,
and your progress on Week 16. These presentations will constitute your attendance
grade on those days, replacing the CodingBat attendance problems. Attendance will
not be mandated on other in-class working days without presentations.

.. warning::
    The late submission policy of -10 points per week late still applies for the
    final project, **except for the final submission**. The grade submission deadline
    is very shortly after the final project submission, so I cannot give any wiggle room.
    If your final submission is not in by the time I submit grades, you will receive no
    credit for anything that you have not already provided to me. As such, I highly
    recommend *not* waiting until the last moment to submit.
