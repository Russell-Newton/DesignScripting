==========================
Topic Selection & Research
==========================

You can make your project on any topic of your choice, as long as some portion of
your project is implemented with Python. If you're working in a team, your project
will also be expected to represent enough work for the number of team members. For
a one-person project, I expect the amount of work to be somewhere in between the
effort needed to create Assignment 3 and Assignment 4. Not necessarily as intensive
as 3, but more so than 4. You're welcome to choose a more intensive project, if you'd
like.

When selecting a topic, emphasize ideas that are interesting or that might be practical.
On that second point, if you're doing something for a studio or another course that you'd
like to address with some sort of programming, I don't mind if you'd like to do that
for your final project. As part of your writeup, you'll be expected to explain why
you chose your topic.

In addition to selecting a topic, you'll need to do some research to find any existing
precedents or related projects that could be inspiration or references when implementing
your project.

Topic Selection Assignment
==========================

:bdg-danger-line:`Due: Monday, March 10, 2025`

You'll need to submit something on Canvas that describes your selected topic,
highlights your research on any existing precedents or related projects, and your
tentative plan on how you're going to implement it. What you submit is up to you,
but because you'll need to present on your selected topic on Monday, March 10 in addition
to submitting it on Canvas, you might want to do a slideshow.

I'll use your submission and your presentation to provide feedback and suggestions,
and, if necessary, request additional implementation goals to bring the workload up
to an appropriate amount.

Selected Topic Description
--------------------------

:bdg-info-line:`Weight: 1%`

Explain the problem and why you'd like to do it.

Make sure you include information about the goals of the project. What do you want
your implementation to be able to do? It can be a good idea to create some milestones
if you have multiple goals for the project.

Research Highlights
-------------------

:bdg-info-line:`Weight: 2%`

You'll need to do some preliminary research when you have your topic selected. This
could look like pictures or papers, whatever you'd prefer, but you need to show me
that you've looked around for inspiration or insight. You'll likely want to do more
research as you complete your project, so this doesn't have to be the same research
you'll present in your writeup at the end of the semester.

Implementation Plan
-------------------

:bdg-info-line:`Weight: 1%`

I don't need specifics here about what sorts of variables you're going to make or
exactly how you intend to accomplish your goal. Broadly, I want to know what order
you think you might try to do things in. It doesn't have to be super complete, mostly
just an outline. Your plan will likely change as your work on the project, but having
some details in mind is a good way to start, and thinking about it before working on
anything can be very helpful.

This could be a good opportunity to try to do something by hand, like we talked about
in :doc:`Week 7 <../../week7/index>`.

Identifying Where to Use Python
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:bdg-info-line:`Weight: 1%`

Additionally, you'll need to talk about what portion of the implementation you think
you'll use Python for. Again, this could change once you start working on your project,
but I want to see that you're thinking about where to use programming from the start,
even if it's something as simple as introducing randomness. Your project could be
possible entirely with Grasshopper alone, but you will need to choose a part of it
to do in Python. This will be important in determining if the scale of the project is
sufficient. If there's anything you think you might want to try to find an open-source
library for, here is where you'll mention that. This is also a good opportunity to talk
about any Grasshopper plugins you intend to use.

Topic Suggestions
=================

Here's a handful of topics that I think would be good projects. You're welcome to
have other ideas, as long as you can meet the criteria above.

Generative Systems
------------------

Generative systems are a fun way to use programming to support creating a wide range
of results.

* Cellular Automata

  * Creating 3D forms
  * Using more states than "on" and "off"
  * Experimenting with stochastic (randomized) cellular automata
  * Take a look at some of the things that the `artist group Troika has done <https://troika.uk.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Trickle-Down-Aesthetics%E2%80%93Greg-J-Smith.pdf>`__

* L-Systems

  * Creating the turtle interpreter
  * Applying the replacement process
  * Experimenting with stochastic (randomized) L-Systems (see `this example <https://userpages.cs.umbc.edu/ebert/693/TLin/node18.html>`__)

* Wave Function Collapse

  * Implementing the collapse algorithm with your own ruleset
  * Using a pre-made collapse algorithm to create design variations

Digital Fabrication
-------------------

Students interested in digital fabrication will likely be using a decent amount of
Grasshopper, in tandem with Python.

* Pattern replication

  * Think Assignments 2 and 3

* Mapping 2D geometry to a surface
* Form creation

  * Height maps
  * Gradient noise layering
  * Randomly sampling points to interpolate
  * Studio Gang and BIG have some interesting things that could be inspiration for
    programmatically creating forms and modular facades.

Studio Work
-----------

If you're doing something for a studio that you'd like to explore with Grasshopper and
Python, you're more than welcome to. Design automation can be very rewarding.

Data Visualization
------------------

Although we haven't spent time talking about data visualization this semester, programmatic
design can be a useful tool for dataviz.

* Site analysis
* Circulation simulations
* Light simulations/analysis
* Exploration on how we perceive different representations of data
