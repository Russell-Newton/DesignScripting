Week 1: Python Basics
=====================

This course uses Python 3 inside Rhino 8 and Grasshopper. In Python, programs are
created by chaining together statements in order to achieve a desired effect.
Statements are formed via expressions, which can themselves be formed via simpler
expressions.

Throughout these sections and those in the future, you will see Python code blocks like
the one below. They will often be commented to explain the code inside of them.
Comments in Python are preceded by a ``#`` symbol. Comments can either be on their
own line or at the end of another line. Anything after the ``#`` will be ignored when
the program is executed. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    # This piece of code prints "Hello, World!" to the console
    # When printing, the quotations (") won't appear
    print("Hello, World!")  # This is an end-of-line comment
